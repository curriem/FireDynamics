\abstract

This document is meant to make sense of the plots, movies, and scripts located in this repository. The discussions in this document will be organized into four sections: 1) real infrared image data, 2) dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for the real IR data, 3)  cellular automata (CA) to model the spread of fires, and 4) fire box data, results, etc.

\section{Real IR Data}
There are three real data sets that we are working with in the subsequent analyses. The datasets are designated 13fsingle1, 13fsingle2, and 13fsingle3, however henceforth they shall be referred to as Fire 1, Fire 2, and Fire 3, respectively. Here we present basic statistics for each of the three datasets.
